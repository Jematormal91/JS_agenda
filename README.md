# AGENDA
##### Algorithm Design in JS / HTML / CSS
You must design an agenda capable of registering the user's name, address, occupation, telephone number and e-mail. For this, the user must enter all this data in text boxes (TextBox) for each one and then press a button, which will perform the function of storing all the data in the agenda, and must have a button to close the application.
